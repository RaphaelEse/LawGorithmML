                     In general
                     In determining whether a practice is an unfair or deceptive practice under section 41712 of title 49, United States Code, with respect to the disclosure of ancillary fees, the Secretary, shall provide air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents with the flexibility to develop the manner in which such information is transmitted to consumers as long as such information (consistent with the objective of assuring that consumers are provided with useable, current, and accurate information on critical ancillary fees in a format that the consumer can easily compare multiple flight options) is—
                     
                        (A)
                        presented to the consumer in a reasonable and transparent manner prior to booking; and

               ACCESS TO CUSTOMER SERVICE ASSISTANCE FOR ALL TRAVELERS
               
                  (a)
                  Findings
                  Congress finds the following:
                  
                     (1)
                     In the event of a cancelled or delayed flight, it is important for customers to be able easily access information about the status of their flight and any alternative flight options.
                  
                  
                     (2)
                     During a period of mass cancellations, customers may be unable to easily connect, either in-person or through a toll-free customer service phone number, with a customer service representative of an air carrier.
                  
                  
                     (3)
                     While many air carriers have robust online and smart phone application chat resources, many customers may not have access to those resources, and customers often have time-sensitive questions that cannot be answered through an automated service or website.
                  
                  
                     (4)
                     Not all customers of air carriers are able to easily use online and chat resources.
                  
                  
                     (5)
                     Customers should be able to access real-time assistance from customer service agents of air carriers without an excessive wait time, particularly during times of mass disruptions.
                  
               
               
                  (b)
                  Transparency requirements
                  
                     (1)

                           Each air carrier and foreign air carrier shall provide on any electronic flight itinerary ticket confirmation issued by the carrier a link to the Aviation Consumer Protection website and the Air Travel Service Complaint or Comment Form website of the Department of Transportation.

                  (a)
                  Findings
                  Congress finds the following:
                  
                     (1)
                     Air travel is an essential part of modern life, and passengers have certain rights and protections under the law.
                  
                  
                     (2)
                     Passengers are often not aware of such rights and protections under the law.
                  
                  
                     (3)
                     To address this problem, airports, air carriers, and foreign air carriers must provide clear and concise information regarding passenger rights in a manner that is easily accessible and understandable to all passengers.

                           (f)
                           Notice to passengers on electronic flight itinerary ticket confirmation
                           Each air carrier and foreign air carrier shall provide on any electronic flight itinerary ticket confirmation issued by the carrier a link to the Aviation Consumer Protection website and the Air Travel Service Complaint or Comment Form website of the Department of Transportation.

                  Flexibility
                  
                     (1)
                     In general
                     In determining whether a practice is an unfair or deceptive practice under section 41712 of title 49, United States Code, with respect to the disclosure of ancillary fees, the Secretary, shall provide air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents with the flexibility to develop the manner in which such information is transmitted to consumers as long as such information (consistent with the objective of assuring that consumers are provided with usable, current, and accurate information on critical ancillary fees in a format that the consumer can easily compare multiple flight options) is—
                     
                        (A)
                        presented to the consumer in a reasonable and transparent manner prior to booking; and

                           one carry-on bag of an airline passenger; 
                        
                        
                           (iii)
                           changing or canceling a reservation; and

                           adjacent seating when traveling with a child that is 13 years of age or younger; and

                        any other fees for ancillary services that are identified by the Secretary in the rule finalizing the proposed rule published by the Secretary on March 3, 2023, and titled Enhancing Transparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees (88 Fed.

                  Ticket agents
                  The Secretary shall not find that a ticket agent is out of compliance with a requirement in the final rule described in subsection (a)(2)(B) with respect to the disclosure of critical ancillary fees if the Secretary determines that such noncompliance is due to the failure of an air carrier or foreign air carrier to provide the ticket agent with the information required to comply with such requirement.

               ACCESS TO CUSTOMER SERVICE ASSISTANCE FOR ALL TRAVELERS
               
                  (a)
                  Findings
                  Congress finds the following:
                  
                     (1)
                     In the event of a cancelled or delayed flight, it is important for customers to be able to easily access information about the status of their flight and any alternative flight options.
                  
                  
                     (2)
                     During a period of mass cancellations, customers may be unable to easily connect, either in-person or through a toll-free customer service phone number, with a customer service representative of an air carrier.
                  
                  
                     (3)
                     While many air carriers have robust online and smart phone application chat resources, many customers may not have access to those resources, and customers often have time-sensitive questions that cannot be answered through an automated service or website.
                  
                  
                     (4)
                     Not all customers of air carriers are able to easily use online and chat resources.
                  
                  
                     (5)
                     Customers should be able to access real-time assistance from customer service agents of air carriers without an excessive wait time, particularly during times of mass disruptions.
                  
               
               
                  (b)
                  Transparency requirements
                  
                     (1)
                     Requirement to maintain a live customer chat or monitored text messaging number
                     
                        Chapter 423 of title 49, United States Code, as amended by section 704(b), is amended by inserting after section 42307 the following:

                                 In general
                                 A covered air carrier that operates a domestic or international flight to, from, or within the United States shall, in addition to maintaining a toll-free customer service telephone line, maintain a live customer chat or monitored text messaging number that enables customers to speak to a live agent directly.

                                 Provision of services
                                 The services required under subsection (a) shall be provided to customers without charge for the use of such services, and shall be available in real time and on a 24 hour/7 days a week basis. 
                              
                           
                           
                              (b)

                              The Secretary shall promulgate such rules as may be necessary to carry out this section.
                           
                           
                              (c)
                              Covered air carrier defined
                              In this section, the term covered air carrier means an air carrier that provides scheduled passenger air transportation by operating an aircraft that as originally designed has a passenger capacity of 30 or more seats.
                           
                           
                              (d)
                              Effective date
                              Beginning on the date that is 120 days after the date of enactment of this section, a covered air carrier shall comply with the requirement specified in subsection (b) without regard to whether the Secretary has promulgated any rules to carry out this section as of the date that is 120 days after such date of enactment.
