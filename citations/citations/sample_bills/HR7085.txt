         SHORT TITLE
         This Act may be cited as the 
               BIOSECURE Act
            .
      
      
         2.
         FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS
         
            (a)
            Findings
            Congress finds the following:
            
               (1)
               The Government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) seeks to dominate biotechnology as an industry of the future.
            
            
               (2)
               In recent years, the PRC has pursued a strategy known as military-civil fusion that merges public and private industries to enable the military modernization of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).
            
            
               (3)
               In the PRC’s 14th Five-Year Plan, the PRC emphasized the use of artificial intelligence for biological discovery and called to accelerate the development of biotechnology.
            
            
               (4)
               PRC biotechnology companies have repeatedly collaborated with PLA entities, including Third Military Medical University and the PLA’s Key Laboratory of High-Altitude Medicine.
            
            
               (5)
               PRC law requires companies that are controlled by a PRC entity, like BGI, to comply with PRC national security laws, which provide the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with the power to compel Chinese companies to turn over their data.
            
            
               (6)
               Pursuant to the PRC’s laws, the PRC can require a company headquartered in the PRC to surrender all its data to the Government of the PRC, making it an espionage tool of the CCP.
            
            
               (7)
               The National Intelligence Law, passed in China in 2017, states that any organization must assist or cooperate with CCP intelligence work.
            
            
               (8)
               China’s 2014 counter-espionage law also states that relevant organizations … may not refuse to collect evidence for an investigation.
            
            
               (9)
               The PRC’s Data Security Law of 2021 states that the Government has the power to access and control private data.
            
            
               (10)
               The PRC’s counter-espionage law grants PRC state security agencies nearly unfettered discretion, if acting under an effectively limitlessly capacious understanding of national security, to access data from companies.
            
            
               (11)
               The executive branch has determined that BGI, formerly known as Beijing Genomics Institute, is a national security threat.
            
            
               (12)
               In October 2022, the Department of Defense added BGI Genomics Co., LTD (BGI) to the Department of Defense’s list of PRC Military Companies.
            
            
               (13)
               In March 2023, the Department of Commerce added BGI Tech Solutions (Hong Kong) a subsidiary of BGI, to the Entity List for concerns the unit poses a significant risk to contributing to PRC Government surveillance.
            
            
               (14)
               In February 2021, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center published a public advisory that the Government of the PRC seeks to leverage access to genetic data to conduct repression and surveillance with mention of BGI’s role in this campaign.
            
            
               (15)
               BGI is engaged in global campaign to collect foreign person’s genetic data.
            
            
               (16)
               As of October 2023, United States press reports BGI operates genetic collection sites or Fire-Eye laboratories, in over 30 countries.
            
            
               (17)
               According to a July 2021 United States press report, BGI collected genetic data from millions of pregnant women through prenatal tests. BGI reportedly has worked with the PLA to improve population quality in the PRC.
            
            
               (18)
               BGI operates the China National GeneBank, the world’s largest repository of genetic data.
            
            
               (19)
               MGI and Complete Genomics are subsidiaries and direct affiliates of BGI that have access to the United States market and population.
            
            
               (20)
               In 2013, BGI purchased United States genomic sequencing firm Complete Genomics.
            
            
               (21)
               According to MGI’s previous Securities and Exchange Commission disclosures, MGI is part of the BGI group and BGI established MGI.
            
            
               (22)
               According to an April 2023 United States press report, BGI founder, Wang Jian, holds 47 percent of MGI shares.
            
            
               (23)
               According to corporate disclosures, Complete Genomics is owned by MGI and is therefore owned by BGI.
            
            
               (24)
               WuXi Apptec presents a national security threat to the United States.
            
            
               (25)
               According to PRC press, WuXi Apptec has sponsored Military-Civil Fusion events in the PRC.
            
            
               (26)
               WuXi AppTec has received investments from a Military-Civil Integration Selected Hybrid Securities Investment Fund.
            
            
               (27)
               According to PRC press, WuXi AppTec has granted awards to PLA researchers and invited PLA institutes to participate in the selection process of company awards.
            
            
               (28)
               Chris Chen, CEO of WuXi Biologics, was previously an adjunct professor at the PLA’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences.
            
         
         
            (b)
            Sense of Congress
            It is the sense of Congress that the time has come to—
            
               (1)
               stop United States taxpayer dollars from flowing to foreign adversary biotech companies like BGI that have ties to the PLA; and
            
            
               (2)
               prevent United States taxpayers from buying biotech equipment from foreign adversaries that facilitate the transfer of United States persons genetic data to a foreign adversary.
