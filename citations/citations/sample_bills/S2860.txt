         REQUIREMENTS FOR DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS
         
            (a)
            Sense of Congress
            It is the sense of Congress that—
            
               (1)
               appropriate Federal banking agencies have a duty to ensure that the depository institutions supervised by those agencies— 
               
                  (A)
                  are operating in a safe and sound manner; and 
               
               
                  (B)
                  have processes and procedures in place to identify fraudulent or illegal activity, whether activity occurs at a depository institution or through vendors or customers with which a depository institution has a relationship;
               
            
            
               (2)
               the duty described in paragraph (1) rests on laws and regulations, not on personal beliefs or political motivations;
            
            
               (3)
               undue pressure and coercion designed to restrict access to financial services for lawful businesses have no place at any appropriate Federal banking agency;
            
            
               (4)
               depository institutions should provide banking services in the communities in which those institutions serve while carrying out customer identification, risk-based customer diligence, and suspicious activity monitoring and reporting obligations under subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code (referred to in this section as the Bank Secrecy Act), with respect to the customers of those institutions;
            
            
               (5)
               despite the fact that individual customers of depository institutions within broader customer categories present varying degrees of risk, all depository institutions should take a risk-based approach in assessing individual customer relationships rather than decline to provide banking services to categories of customers without regard to the risks presented by an individual customer or the ability of the depository institution to manage the risk;
            
            
               (6)
               depository institutions that properly manage customer relationships and risks are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing services to customers that are operating in compliance with applicable Federal and State law; and 
            
            
               (7)
               each depository institution is responsible for determining whether providing services to any particular customer is consistent with the business plan, risk profile, and management capabilities of the depository institution.
            
         
         
            (b)
            Conditions for termination
            
               (1)
               In general
               An appropriate Federal banking agency may not request or require a depository institution to terminate a specific deposit account or group of deposit accounts (including, but not limited to, any deposit account of any customer that is a State-sanctioned marijuana business or service provider), unless—
               
                  (A)
                  there is a valid reason for that request or requirement, as described in paragraph (2); and
               
               
                  (B)
                  reputational risk is not the dispositive factor for that request or requirement.
               
            
            
               (2)
               Valid reasons
               
                  (A)
                  In general
                  To establish a valid reason for a request or requirement under paragraph (1), the appropriate Federal banking agency shall document that the agency—
                  
                     (i)
                     has reasonable cause to believe that the applicable depository institution or any institution-affiliated party has engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in—
                     
                        (I)
                        an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting business;
                     
                     
                        (II)
                        a violation of an applicable law, rule, regulation, order, condition imposed in writing, formal or informal enforcement action, or written agency formal or informal guidance, which shall include the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 5318(h)(4) of title 31, United States Code, or otherwise operating in a manner that is inconsistent with requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act; or
                     
                     
                        (III)
                        any activity, conduct, or condition that could lead to, or has led to, the issuance of a matter requiring attention, a matter requiring immediate attention, a matter requiring board attention, a document of resolution, or a supervisory recommendation; or
                     
                  
                  
                     (ii)
                     has another reason, determined to be valid in the discretion of the agency, for making that request or imposing that requirement.
                  
               
               
                  (A)
                  In general
                  To establish a valid reason for a request or requirement under paragraph (1), the appropriate Federal banking agency shall document that valid reason, which may include that the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the applicable depository institution or any institution-affiliated party has engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in—
                  
                     (i)
                     an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting business;
                  
                  
                     (ii)
                     a violation of an applicable law, rule, regulation, order, condition imposed in writing, formal or informal enforcement action, or written agency guidance, which shall include the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 5318(h)(4) of title 31, United States Code, or otherwise operating in a manner that is inconsistent with requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act; or
                  
                  
                     (iii)
                     any activity, conduct, or condition that could lead to, or has led to, the issuance of a matter requiring attention, a matter requiring immediate attention, a matter requiring board attention, a document of resolution, or a supervisory recommendation. 
                  
               
               
                  (B)
                  Treatment of national security and illicit finance threats
                  If an appropriate Federal banking agency has reasonable cause to believe that a specific customer or group of customers is, or is acting for or on behalf of, an entity that—
                  
                     (i)
                     poses a threat to national security;
                  
                  
                     (ii)
                     is involved in terrorist or other illicit financing;
                  
                  
                     (iii)
                     is an agent of the Government of Iran, North Korea, Syria, the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, or any country listed on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list;
                  
                  
                     (iv)
                     is in, or is subject to the jurisdiction of, any country described in clause (iii)
                        listed on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list; 
                  
                  
                     (v)
                     does business with any entity described in clause (iii) or (iv), unless the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that the customer or group of customers has conducted due diligence to avoid doing business with any entity described in clause (iii) or (iv); or
                  
                  
                     (vi)
                     is engaged in— 
                     
                        (I)
                        any other illicit conduct directly or indirectly supporting a transnational criminal organization, drug trafficking organization, or money laundering organization; or 
                     
                     
                        (II)
                        any other criminal activity,
                     
                  
                  such belief shall satisfy the conditions permitting action by the appropriate Federal banking agency under paragraph (1).
               
            
         
         
            (c)

               (1)
               provide such request or requirement to the institution in writing; and

               (1)

               Except as provided in paragraph (2), or as otherwise prohibited from disclosure by law, if an appropriate Federal banking agency requests or requires a depository institution to terminate a deposit account under subsection (b), the depository institution shall notify in writing the specific customer or group of customers, the deposit account of which is being terminated, of the valid reason for that termination, as determined under subsection (b)(2). 
            
            
               (2)

                           (bb)
                           involves a matter described in subsection (b)(2)(B); or
                        
                        
                           (cc)

                        the depository institution or appropriate Federal banking agency knows or should know that, with respect to that customer or group of customers, a criminal prosecution or a law enforcement investigation is pending.
                     
                  
                  
                     (ii)
                     Consultation and recommendations
