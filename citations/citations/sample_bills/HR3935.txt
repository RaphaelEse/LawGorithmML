            SENSE OF CONGRESS ON USE OF ADVANCED SURVEILLANCE IN OCEANIC AIRSPACE
            It is the sense of Congress the FAA shall continue to evaluate the potential uses for space-based automatic dependent surveillance broadcast to improve surveillance coverage of domestic airspace including improving surveillance coverage over remote terrain and in oceanic airspace. If determined appropriate by the Administrator, the FAA shall consider whether additional testing would meaningfully contribute to the FAA’s processes for developing separation standards and more efficient routes.
