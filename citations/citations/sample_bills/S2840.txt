If a hospital does not provide 300 shoppable services in accordance with the previous sentence, the hospital shall make public the information specified under paragraph (1) for as many shoppable services as it provides.

                              (ii)
                              The tool allows health care consumers to, at the time they use the tool, obtain an estimate of the amount they will be obligated to pay the hospital for the shoppable service.

                                 A statement that the actual charges for an individual's covered item or service may be different from an estimate of cost-sharing liability depending on the actual items or services the individual receives at the point of care.

                              (III)

                              (IV)
                              Out-of-network allowed amount

                              (VI)
                              Underlying fee schedule rate
