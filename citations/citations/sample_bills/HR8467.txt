                        Requirements
                        A responsible party shall, as a condition of enrollment in the pilot program, agree to— 
                        
                           (1)
                           maintain, move, and dispose of covered microorganisms in a manner that prevents unauthorized release, spread, dispersal, or persistence of those covered microorganisms in the environment;
                         
                        
                           (2)
                           unless otherwise authorized under a permit under this Act, only move a covered microorganism between sites that are responsible party biocontainment facilities;
                         
                        
                           (3)
                           maintain, move, and dispose of each covered microorganism separately from other organisms;
                         
                        
                           (4)
                           ensure that each covered microorganism is maintained, moved, and disposed of in a manner commensurate with the plant pest risk posed by that covered microorganism;
                         
                        
                           (5)

                              (C)
                              the outer container of which is rigid and strong enough to withstand typical shipping conditions (such as dropping, stacking, and impact from other freight) without opening;

                           on request, grant the Secretary access— 
                           
                              (A)
                              to sample materials associated with the interstate movement of covered microorganisms under the pilot program;
                            
                           
                              (B)
                              to observe and inspect the interstate movement of those covered microorganisms; and
                            
                           
                              (C)
                              to audit records of the activities of the responsible party under the pilot program;
                           
                         
                        
                           (7)
                           maintain detailed and accurate records of all activities carried out under the pilot program to demonstrate compliance with the applicable requirements;
                         
                        
                           (8)
                           on request, grant the Secretary access to each responsible party biocontainment facility for inspection in relation to a responsible party’s enrollment in the pilot program; and
                         
                        
                           (9)
                           comply with any additional requirement for the containment of covered microorganisms in interstate commerce that the Secretary may require if— 
                           
                              (A)
                              the Secretary determines that such an additional requirement is reasonable; and
                            
                           
                              (B)
                              the sole purpose of such additional requirement is to avoid a covered unauthorized release.
                           
                        
                      
                     
                        (f)
                        Prohibition on certain preferences
                        In carrying out the pilot program, the Secretary shall take no action or promulgate any regulation that— 
                        
                           (1)
                           treats genetically engineered covered microorganisms less favorably than nongenetically engineered covered microorganisms; or
                         
                        
                           (2)
                           limits the quantity or type of covered microorganisms that may be moved under the pilot program between responsible party biocontainment facilities.

                        Termination
                        The pilot program shall terminate on the date that is 3 years after the date on which the Secretary completes the application selection process under subsection (d)(1)(B).
