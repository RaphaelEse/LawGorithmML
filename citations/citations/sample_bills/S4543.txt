                        The use of such a contract is consistent with the Chief of Naval Operations’ projected force structure requirements for such craft.
                     
                     
                        (2)

                        (3)
                        There is a stable design for the property to be acquired and the technical risks associated with such property are not excessive.
                     
                     
                        (4)
                        The estimates of both the cost of the contract and the anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a contract authorized under subsection (a) are realistic, including a description of the basis for such estimates.

                        (1)
                        The use of such a contract is consistent with the Department of the Navy’s projected force structure requirements for such ships. 
                     
                     
                        (2)

                        (3)
                        There is a reasonable expectation that throughout the contemplated contract period the Secretary of the Navy will request funding for the contract at the level required to avoid contract cancellation.

                        the total liability of the Federal Government for termination of the contract shall be limited to the total amount of funding obligated to the contract at the time of termination.
                     
                  
                  
                     (c)
                     Certification required
                     A contract may not be entered into under subsection (a) unless the Secretary of Defense certifies to the congressional defense committees, in writing, not later than 30 days before entry into the contract, each of the following, which shall be prepared by the milestone decision authority (as defined in section 4251(d) of title 10, United States Code) for the program:
                     
                        (1)
                        The use of such a contract will result in significant savings compared to the total anticipated costs of carrying out the program through annual contracts. In certifying cost savings under the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall include a written explanation of—
                        
                           (A)
                           the estimated obligations and expenditures by fiscal year for the program without the authority provided in subsection (a);
                        
                        
                           (B)
                           the estimated obligations and expenditures by fiscal year for the program with the authority provided in subsection (a);
                        
                        
                           (C)
                           the estimated cost savings or increase by fiscal year for the program with the authority provided in subsection (a);
                        
                        
                           (D)
                           the discrete actions that will accomplish such cost savings or avoidance; and
                        
                        
                           (E)
                           the contractual actions that will ensure the estimated cost savings are realized.
                        
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        There is a reasonable expectation that throughout the contemplated contract period the Secretary of Defense will request funding for the contract at the level required to avoid contract cancellation.
                     
                     
                        (3)
                        There is a stable design for the property to be acquired and the technical risks associated with such property are not excessive.
                     
                     
                        (4)
                        The estimates of both the cost of the contract and the anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a contract authorized under subsection (a) are realistic.
                     
                     
                        (5)
                        The use of such a contract will promote the national security of the United States.
                     
                     
                        (6)
                        During the fiscal year in which such contract is to be awarded, sufficient funds will be available to perform the contract in such fiscal year, and the future-years defense program submitted to Congress under section 221 of title 10, United States Code, for such fiscal year will include the funding required to execute the program without cancellation.
                     
                     
                        (7)
                        The contract will be a fixed price type contract.

                        the United States is entering into an unprecedented period of strategic competition with two potential adversaries, each of which now possesses, or will acquire, nuclear and missile forces equal to or greater than such forces possessed by the United States;
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        ensuring the continued deterrence of the growing threat of the nuclear capabilities of such adversaries requires— 
                        
                           (A)
                           safe, secure, effective, and credible nuclear forces, with a range of flexible employment options, available to the President; and 
                        
                        
                           (B)
                           robust missile forces capable of overcoming current and future missile defenses;
                        
                     
                     
                        (3)
                        such forces can only be achieved through the rapid and complete modernization of legacy nuclear capabilities of the United States and the timely development of a range of ballistic, cruise, and hypersonic boost-glide missiles;
                     
                     
                        (4)
                        ongoing Department of Defense and National Nuclear Security Administration programs and projects to achieve the modernization of United States nuclear forces enjoy virtually no scheduled margin for delivery prior to the expected retirement or decommissioning of legacy systems and facilities, even as the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and North Korea work to rapidly modernize and expand their nuclear arsenals;
                     
                     
                        (5)
                        the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and North Korea are—
                        
                           (A)
                           engaged in a variety of missile programs intended to defeat the missile defense capabilities of the United States and its allies; and 
                        
                        
                           (B)
                           expected to field such capabilities in greater volumes than the United States;
                        
                     
                     
                        (6)
                        imbalances in such capabilities are inherently destabilizing and represent profound risks to the security of the United States and its allies and to global stability at large;
                     
                     
                        (7)
                        the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy should leverage all available tools to reduce the risk of schedule delays in nuclear modernization and hypersonic missile programs and projects, including by—
                        
                           (A)
                           universally applying the authorities provided by the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) to each such program or project; and 
                        
                        
                           (B)
                           assigning a DX priority rating under part 700 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations, to each such program or project;
                        
                     
                     
                        (8)
                        the assignment of DX priority ratings would help minimize the risk that such programs and projects are unnecessarily delayed due to misallocations of industrial materials, services, or facilities; and
                     
                     
                        (9)
                        the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy should promptly inform Congress of any additional opportunities to further reduce risks relating to such programs and projects or the schedules for such programs and projects that could be achieved through the adjustment of existing authorities.

                        Not later than January 1, 2023, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy shall jointly submit to the congressional defense committees a report including—
                        
                           (A)
                           with respect to each nuclear weapons delivery system, missile warning system, hypersonic boost-glide missile system program, or weapon program or nuclear security enterprise infrastructure project of the National Nuclear Security Administration, a determination of whether such program or project should be assigned a DX priority rating under part 700 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations;
                        
                        
                           (B)
                           for any such program or project that the respective Secretary determines under subparagraph (A) should be assigned a DX priority rating, a confirmation that such program or project has been assigned a DX rating; and
                        
                        
                           (C)
                           for any such program or project that has not been assigned a DX priority rating as of January 1, 2023—
                           
                              (i)
                              an explanation for any delay in assigning such a rating; and
                           
                           
                              (ii)
                              a timeline for the assignment of such a rating.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        Annual certification
                        For any nuclear weapons delivery system, missile warning system, hypersonic boost-glide missile system program, or weapon program or nuclear security enterprise infrastructure project of the National Nuclear Security Administration that the respective Secretary determines under paragraph (1)(A) should not be assigned a DX priority rating , the Secretary shall, until such program reaches full operational capability, annually submit to the congressional defense committees a certification that the lack of assignment of such rating will not negatively affect the delivery of operational capabilities by such program or project.
                     
                     
                        (3)
                        Nondelegation
                        The Secretary may not delegate a determination under paragraph (1)(A) to any other official.

                              Establishment of program
                              The Secretary of Defense shall establish a program to be known as the Mentor-Protege Program.

                              Purpose
                              The purpose of the program is to provide incentives for major Department of Defense contractors to furnish disadvantaged small business concerns with assistance designed to—
                              
                                 (1)
                                 enhance the capabilities of disadvantaged small business concerns to perform as subcontractors and suppliers under Department of Defense contracts and other contracts and subcontracts; and
                              
                              
                                 (2)
                                 increase the participation of such business concerns as subcontractors and suppliers under Department of Defense contracts, other Federal Government contracts, and commercial contracts.
                              
                           
                           
                              (c)
                              Program participants
                              
                                 (1)
                                 A business concern meeting the eligibility requirements set out in subsection (d) may enter into agreements under subsection (e) and furnish assistance to disadvantaged small business concerns upon making application to the Secretary of Defense and being approved for participation in the program by the Secretary. A business concern participating in the program pursuant to such an approval shall be known, for the purposes of the program, as a mentor firm.
                              
                              
                                 (2)
                                 A disadvantaged small business concern eligible for the award of Federal contracts may obtain assistance from a mentor firm upon entering into an agreement with the mentor firm as provided in subsection (e). A disadvantaged small business concern may not be a party to more than one agreement concurrently, and the authority to enter into agreements under subsection (e) shall only be available to such concern during the 5-year period beginning on the date such concern enters into the first such agreement. A disadvantaged small business concern receiving such assistance shall be known, for the purposes of the program, as a protege firm.
                              
                              
                                 (3)
                                 In entering into an agreement pursuant to subsection (e), a mentor firm may rely in good faith on a written representation of a business concern that such business concern is a disadvantaged small business concern. The Small Business Administration shall determine the status of such business concern as a disadvantaged small business concern in the event of a protest regarding the status of such business concern. If at any time the business concern is determined by the Small Business Administration not to be a disadvantaged small business concern, assistance furnished such business concern by the mentor firm after the date of the determination may not be considered assistance furnished under the program.

                  STUDY OF PROPOSED SPACE FORCE REORGANIZATION
                  
                     (a)
                     In general
                     Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall seek to enter into a contract with one or more federally funded research and development centers to conduct a study on the proposed reorganization of the Space Force and the establishment of the Space Component.
                  
                  
                     (b)

                     The study referred to in subsection (a) shall include a comprehensive review and assessment of—
                     
                        (1)
                        the feasibility and advisability of—
                        
                           (A)
                           exempting the proposed Space Component from the existing up or out system of officer career advancement first established by the amendments to title 10, United States Code, made by the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (Public Law 96–513; 94 Stat. 2835);
                        
                        
                           (B)
                           combining active and reserve components in a new, single Space Component and whether a similar outcome could be achieved using the existing active and reserve component frameworks with modest statutory changes to allow reserve officers to serve on sustained active duty;
                        
                        
                           (C)
                           creating career flexibility for reserve members of the Space Component, including in shifting retirement points earned from one year to the next and allowing members of the Space Component to move back and forth between active and reserve status for prolonged periods of time across a career;
                        
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        the implications of the proposed reorganization of the Space Force on the development of space as a warfighting domain in the profession of arms, particularly with respect to officer leadership, development, and stewardship of the profession;
                     
                     
                        (3)
                        whether existing government ethics regulations are adequate to address potential conflicts of interest for Space Component officers who seek to move back and forth between sustained active duty and working for private sector organizations in the space industry as reserve officers in the Space Component;
                     
                     
                        (4)
                        whether the proposed Space Component framework is consistent with the joint service requirements of chapter 38 of title 10, United States Code;
                     
                     
                        (5)
                        budgetary implications of the establishment of the Space Component;
                     
                     
                        (6)
                        the nature of the relationship with private industry and civilian employers that would be required and consistent with professional ethics to successfully implement the Space Component; and
                     
                     
                        (7)
                        any other issues the Secretary or the federally funded research and development center considers relevant.

                     Diversity and inclusion
                     The study referred to in subsection (a) shall include an assessment of the proposed reorganization of the Space Force and the establishment of the Space Component on advancing diversity and inclusion in the Space Component.
                  
                  
                     (d)
                     Limitation on delegation
                     The authority of the Secretary to enter into a contract under subsection (a) may not be delegated below the level the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.
                  
                  
                     (e)

                  PRIORITIZATION AND ACCELERATION OF INVESTMENTS TO ATTAIN THREAT MATRIX FRAMEWORK LEVEL 4 CAPABILITY AT TRAINING RANGES SUPPORTING F–35 OPERATIONS
                  
                     (a)
                     Sense of Congress
                     It is the sense of the Senate that—
                     
                        (1)
                        the Air Force must train to fight and win in highly contested and competitive environments against technologically advanced adversaries;
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        in order for the Air Force to be proficient in tactics, techniques, and procedures and effectively execute at an operational level, the Air Force must train in an accurately replicated multi-domain environment for joint operations;
                     
                     
                        (3)
                        the Air Force can emulate only a fraction of existing and emerging threats to a level suitable for advanced sensors and cannot provide a contested or degraded environment with the threats available at the two major training ranges of the Air Force; and
                     
                     
                        (4)
                        since the Secretary of the Air Force says the Air Force cannot afford to allocate advanced capabilities across all ranges, the Air Force must prioritize developments and upgrades for ranges to ensure that one or more ranges have a complete suite of capability to conduct advanced F–35 training.
                     
                  
                  
                     (b)

                        (1)
                        In general
                        The Secretary of the Air Force shall prioritize and accelerate investments to develop and upgrade one or more ranges to attain threat matrix framework level 4 capability, such as peer capability, by not later than fiscal year 2026.
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        Elements
                        In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Air Force shall prioritize—
                        
                           (A)

                           (G)
                           contested-degraded operations jamming suites;
                        
                        
                           (H)
                           higher fidelity targets with more advanced characteristics;

                        (1)
                        the members of the Armed Forces of the United States—
                        
                           (A)

                           (B)
                           go to great lengths to minimize civilian harm during the conduct of military operations; and
                        
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        the Russian Federation has demonstrated a complete disregard for the safety of civilians during its unlawful and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which has involved indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas and executions of noncombatants.

                  SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION
                  It is the sense of the Senate that—
                  
                     (1)
                     the success of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is critical to advancing United States national security objectives in Europe and around the world;
                  
                  
                     (2)
                     NATO remains the strongest and most successful military alliance in the world, founded on a commitment by its members to uphold the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law;
                  
                  
                     (3)
                     the contributions of NATO to the collective defense are indispensable to the security, prosperity, and freedom of its members;
                  
                  
                     (4)
                     the United States reaffirms its ironclad commitment—
                     
                        (A)
                        to NATO as the foundation of transatlantic security; and
                     
                     
                        (B)
                        to upholding the obligations of the United States under the North Atlantic Treaty, done at Washington, DC, April 4, 1949, including Article 5 of the Treaty;
                     
                  
                  
                     (5)
                     the 2022 National Defense Strategy correctly highlights the criticality of alliances and partnerships, stating that [m]utually-beneficial alliances and partnerships are an enduring strength for the United States, and are critical to achieving our objectives, as the unified response to Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated;
                  
                  
                     (6)
                     the Russian Federation's premeditated and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine poses the most direct threat to security and stability in Europe since the end of World War II and requires the full attention of the NATO alliance;
                  
                  
                     (7)
                     the unprovoked and illegal war conducted by the Russian Federation against Ukraine has fundamentally altered the concept of transatlantic security and requires—
                     
                        (A)
                        a reinvigorated commitment to the shared principles of the NATO alliance; and
                     
                     
                        (B)
                        a commensurate response to deter further revanchism by the Russian Federation in the Euro-Atlantic region;
                     
                  
                  
                     (8)
                     as NATO refocuses its deterrence and defense posture to respond to the Russian Federation's escalatory actions, allies must simultaneously address threats posed across all domains and all areas of the Euro-Atlantic region, including—
                     
                        (A)
                        threats posed by predatory investments and influence operations carried out by the People's Republic of China;
                     
                     
                        (B)

                     (9)
                     to respond to aggression by the Russian Federation and address other threats, the NATO alliance should—
                     
                        (A)
                        assess opportunities to further bolster the NATO enhanced Forward Presence and enhanced Vigilance Activity battlegroups;
                     
                     
                        (B)

                        (E)
                        continue efforts to identify, coordinate, and deliver humanitarian aid and security assistance to Ukraine;
                     
                     
                        (F)
                        intensify efforts to work with NATO allies to establish and enhance rapid and assured movement of military forces throughout the North Atlantic region and across the continent of Europe on land, on and under the sea, and in the air, including through increased investment, coordination, and standardization intended to identify and reduce obstacles to the movement of United States and allied military forces in a time of crisis or conflict;
                     
                     
                        (G)
                        reaffirm the open-door policy of NATO to allow any European country to apply for membership and be considered on its merits for admission, including—
                        
                           (i)
                           aspirants such as Ukraine, Georgia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina; and
                        
                        
                           (ii)
                           Finland and Sweden, which in the wake of the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine, have sought NATO membership to further bolster their own security and the security of the Euro-Atlantic region; and

                     (10)
                     the United States and fellow NATO allies should continue long-term efforts—
                     
                        (A)
                        to improve interoperability among the military forces of NATO allies and non-NATO allies so as to enhance effective and efficient collective operations, including by the divestment of Soviet-era platforms;
                     
                     
                        (B)
                        to strive for continued progress on key initiatives set forth in recent NATO summits, including readiness, military mobility, multi-domain operations, and resilience;
                     
                     
                        (C)
                        to enhance security sector cooperation and explore opportunities to reinforce civil sector preparedness and resilience measures, which may be likely targets of malign influence and hybrid campaigns;
                     
                     
                        (D)
                        to mitigate the impact of hybrid warfare operations, particularly such operations in the information and cyber domains;
                     
                     
                        (E)
                        to expand joint research and development initiatives, with a focus on emerging technologies such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning;
                     
                     
                        (F)
                        to enhance interoperability, build institutional capacity, and strengthen the collective ability of NATO allies to resist malign influence from the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China; and
                     
                     
                        (G)
                        to coordinate and de-conflict security efforts and the dedication of resources with the European Union—
                        
                           (i)
                           to ensure the fulfilment of European Union and NATO common interests and objectives; and
                        
                        
                           (ii)
                           to minimize unnecessary overlaps;
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     (11)
                     the European Deterrence Initiative remains critically important, including for purposes of strengthening allied and partner capability and power projection along the eastern flank of NATO, and has demonstrated its unique value during the current Russian Federation attack on Ukraine;
                  
                  
                     (12)
                     NATO should maintain cooperation on COVID–19 pandemic response efforts and expand cooperation for future pandemic and disaster preparedness;
                  
                  
                     (13)
                     the policy of the United States should be to work with NATO and other allies and partners to build permanent mechanisms to strengthen supply chains, enhance supply chain security, fill supply chain gaps, and maintain commitments made at the June 2020 NATO Defense Ministerial, particularly with respect to pandemic response preparations;
                  
                  
                     (14)
                     the United States and NATO should expand cooperation efforts on cybersecurity issues to prevent adversaries and criminals from compromising critical systems and infrastructure; and
                  
                  
                     (15)
                     the adoption by NATO of a robust strategy toward the Black Sea is in the interest of the United States, and the United States should consider collaborating with interested allies and partner countries to advance a coordinated strategy that includes diverse elements of the transatlantic security architecture.

                     (2)
                     the Russian Federation’s premeditated and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine—
                     
                        (A)
                        willfully violates the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and the democratic aspirations of the people of Ukraine; and
                     
                     
                        (B)

                     (4)
                     the Russian Federation has no right or authority to veto Ukraine’s pursuit of membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), or the determination of any country to make its own decision to pursue such membership in accordance with NATO’s open door policy;
                  
                  
                     (5)
                     the United States, fellow NATO allies and partners, and the international community have—
                     
                        (A)
                        rallied support and coordinated assistance for Ukraine;

                        (C)

                     (6)
                     the United States should—
                     
                        (A)
                        continue to work closely with NATO allies and non-NATO allies and partners to support the ability of Ukraine to repel and rebuild from the Russian Federation’s invasion, including by—
                        
                           (i)
                           continuing to provide the Government of Ukraine with targeted security, intelligence, and humanitarian assistance to strengthen the defenses of Ukraine and mitigate suffering wrought by the Russian Federation's brutality, consistent with the security interests of the United States;
                        
                        
                           (ii)
                           coordinating sanctions, export restrictions, and other economic penalties against the Russian Federation and any country that enables the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine; and

                        (B)
                        consider whether further adjustments to United States strategy or military force posture within the area of responsibility of the United States European Command are necessitated by the upheaval of the security environment caused by the Russian Federation;
                     
                     
                        (C)

                        (D)

                     (a)
                     Definitions
                     In this section:
                     
                        (1)
                        Deny
                        The term deny means to use combined joint operations to delay, degrade, and ultimately defeat an attempt by the People’s Republic of China to execute a fait accompli against Taiwan, resulting in—
                        
                           (A)
                           the termination of hostilities or at least the attempted fait accompli; or
                        
                        
                           (B)
                           the neutralization of the ability of the People’s Republic of China to execute a fait accompli against Taiwan.
                        
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        Fait accompli
                        The term fait accompli refers to the strategy of the People’s Republic of China for invading and seizing control of Taiwan before the United States Armed Forces can respond effectively, while simultaneously deterring an effective combined joint response by the United States Armed Forces by convincing the United States that mounting such a response would be prohibitively difficult or costly.
                     
                  
                  
                     (b)
                     Statement of policy
                     Consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), it shall be the policy of the United States to maintain the ability of the United States Armed Forces to deny a fait accompli against Taiwan in order to deter the People’s Republic of China from using military force to unilaterally change the status quo with Taiwan.

                     (2)
                     underscores the importance of the Department continuing to prioritize the deterrence of aggression by the People's Republic of China, particularly in the form of an invasion of Taiwan by the People's Republic of China, as the Government of the People’s Republic of China expands and modernizes the People’s Liberation Army; and
                  
                  
                     (3)
                     strongly urges the Department to manage force allocations across theaters to ensure, consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), that the United States Armed Forces maintain the ability to deny a fait accompli against Taiwan by the People’s Republic of China in order to deter the People’s Republic of China from using force to unilaterally change the status quo with Taiwan.

                  SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DEFENSE ALLIANCES AND PARTNERSHIPS IN THE INDO-PACIFIC REGION
                  
                     (a)
                     Findings
                     Congress makes the following findings:
                     
                        (1)
                        The United States Indo-Pacific strategy states, we will prioritize our single greatest asymmetric strength: our network of security alliances and partnerships. Across the region, the United States will work with allies and partners to deepen our interoperability and develop and deploy advanced warfighting capabilities as we support them in defending their citizens and their sovereign interests..
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        The fact sheet accompanying the National Defense Strategy states, [m]utually-beneficial Alliances and partnerships are an enduring strength for the United States, and are critical to achieving our objectives … the Department [of Defense] will incorporate ally and partner perspectives, competencies, and advantages at every stage of defense planning..
                     
                     
                        (3)
                        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Milley testified on April 7, 2022, that our alliances and partnerships are our most significant asymmetric advantages and are key to maintaining the international rules-based order that offers the best opportunities for peace and prosperity for America and the globe..

                        Commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Aquilino testified on March 10, 2022, that a key U.S. asymmetric advantage that our security challengers do not possess is our network of strong alliances and partnerships. Because these relationships are based on shared values and people-to-people ties, they provide significant advantages such as long-term mutual trust, understanding, respect, interoperability, and a common commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific..

                        In general
                        For purposes of nomenclature and life cycle maintenance, each wing level configuration of the LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile shall be considered a weapon system.
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        Definitions
                        In this subsection:
                        
                           (A)
                           Weapon system
                           The term weapon system has the meaning given the term in Department of the Air Force Pamphlet 63-128, updated February 3, 2021. 
                        
                        
                           (B)
                           Wing level configuration
                           The term wing level configuration means the complete arrangement of subsystems and equipment of the LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile required to function as a wing.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     (e)

                  SENSE OF THE SENATE AND BRIEFING ON NUCLEAR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM
                  
                     (a)
                     Sense of the Senate
                     It is the sense of the Senate that—
                     
                        (1)
                        the United States strategic nuclear deterrent, and the independent strategic nuclear deterrents of the United Kingdom and the French Republic, are the supreme guarantee of the security of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (commonly referred to as NATO) and continue to underwrite peace and security for all members of the NATO alliance;
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        the security of the NATO alliance also relies upon nuclear sharing arrangements that predate, and are fully consistent with, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, 1960 (commonly referred to as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty);
                     
                     
                        (3)
                        such arrangements provide for the forward deployment of United States nuclear weapons in Europe, along with the supporting capabilities, infrastructure, and dual-capable aircraft dedicated to the delivery of United States nuclear weapons, provided by European NATO allies;
                     
                     
                        (4)
                        in parallel to the independent commitments of the United States and the United Kingdom to the enduring security of NATO, the nuclear programs of the United States and the United Kingdom have enjoyed significant collaborative benefits as a result of the cooperative relationship formalized in the Agreement for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes, signed at Washington July 3, 1958, and entered into force August 4, 1958, between the United States and the United Kingdom (commonly referred to as the Mutual Defense Agreement);
                     
                     
                        (5)
                        the unique partnership between the United States and the United Kingdom has enhanced sovereign military and scientific capabilities, strengthened bilateral ties, and resulted in the sharing of costs;
                     
                     
                        (6)
                        as the international security environment deteriorates and potential adversaries expand and enhance their nuclear forces, the extended deterrence commitments of the United Kingdom play an increasingly important role in supporting the security interests of the United States and allies of the United States and the United Kingdom;
                     
                     
                        (7)
                        additionally, the extension of the nuclear deterrence commitments of the United Kingdom to members of the NATO alliance strengthens collective security while reducing the burden placed on United States nuclear forces to deter potential adversaries and assure allies of the United States;
                     
                     
                        (8)
                        it is in the national security interest of the United States to support the United Kingdom with respect to the decision of the Government of the United Kingdom to maintain its nuclear forces to deter countries that are significantly increasing and diversifying their nuclear arsenals and investing in novel nuclear technologies and developing new warfighting nuclear systems that could threaten NATO allies, as outlined in the March 2021 report of the Government of the United Kingdom entitled, Global Britain in a Competitive Age: The Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy;
                     
                     
                        (9)
                        as the United States continues to modernize its aging nuclear forces to ensure its ability to continue to field a nuclear deterrent that is safe, secure, and effective, the United Kingdom faces a similar challenge;
                     
                     
                        (10)
                        bilateral cooperation on such programs as the Trident II D5 weapons system, the common missile compartment for the future Dreadnought and Columbia classes of submarines, and the parallel development of the W93/Mk7 warhead of the United States and the replacement warhead of the United Kingdom, will allow the United States and the United Kingdom to responsibly address challenges within their legacy nuclear forces in a cost-effective manner that—
                        
                           (A)
                           preserves independent, sovereign control;
                        
                        
                           (B)
                           is consistent with each country’s obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; and
                        
                        
                           (C)
                           supports nonproliferation objectives; and
                        
                     
                     
                        (11)
                        continued cooperation between the nuclear programs of United States and the United Kingdom is essential to ensuring that the NATO alliance continues to be supported by credible nuclear forces capable of preserving peace, preventing coercion, and deterring aggression.
                     
                  
                  
                     (b)
                     Briefing
                     Not later than March 4, 2023, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment shall brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on opportunities to further enhance and strengthen the bilateral partnership between the nuclear enterprises of the United States and the United Kingdom, including potential cooperation in areas such as advanced manufacturing, microelectronics, supercomputing, and production modernization.
