                                    In general
                                    For the purposes of subsection (c), an institution shall determine, prior to the first award year in which a student enrolls at the institution, the maximum total price that may be charged to the student for completion of a program of study at the institution for the minimum guarantee period applicable to a student, before application of any Federal Pell Grants or other Federal financial aid under this title. Such a maximum total price for completion shall be determined for students in each income category and student aid index category (as determined in accordance with section 132(c)(2)(A)). In determining the maximum total price for completion to be charged to each such category of students, the institution may consider the ability of a category of students to pay tuition and fees (including the required costs described in section 124(b)(3)(A)(i)(I)), but may not include in such consideration any Federal Pell Grants or other Federal financial aid awards that may be available to such category of students under this title.
                                 
                                 
                                    (2)
                                    Multiple maximum total price guarantees
                                    In the event that a student receives more than one maximum total price guarantee because the student is included in more than one category of students for which the institution determines a maximum total price guarantee amount for the purposes of subsection (c), the maximum total price guarantee applicable to such student for the purposes of this section shall be equal to the lowest such guarantee amount.

                                       Prior to a change in ownership resulting in a change of control, an institution may seek a pretransaction determination about whether the institution will meet the applicable requirements of section 102 or 103(13) and this section after such proposed change in ownership by submitting to the Secretary a materially complete pretransaction review application.
                                    
                                    
                                       (ii)
                                       In reviewing applications submitted under clause (i), the Secretary shall only provide a comprehensive review of each such application, and may not provide an abbreviated or partial review.
                                    
                                    
                                       (iii)
                                       If an institution submits a materially complete pretransaction review application at least 90 days prior to the transaction and the Secretary approves the application, the subsequent change in ownership application shall also be approved and the institution shall be certified as meeting the requirements for such transaction, provided that the institution—
                                       
                                          (I)
                                          complies with the applicable terms of this section; and
                                       
                                       
                                          (II)
                                          the transaction resulting in a change of control does not differ materially in its terms from the transaction proposed in the pretransaction review application.

                              (i)
                              in subparagraph (E), by striking or at the end;

                                    in the case of a proprietary institution of higher education, a conversion to a public or other nonprofit institution of higher education.
                                 
                                 ;
                              
                           
                        
                        
                           (D)
                           by adding at the end the following:
                           
                              
                                 (5)
                                 
                                    (A)
                                    Subject to subparagraph (B), when any institution submits an application for a change in ownership resulting in a change in control under this section or submits a pretransaction review application under paragraph (1)(B) (other than in the case of a conversion transaction), the institution shall be required to pay to the Secretary an administrative fee that shall—
                                    
                                       (i)
                                       be in an amount equal to 0.15 percent of the total institutional revenue derived from this title by such institution for the most fiscal year for which data is available; and
                                    
                                    
                                       (ii)

                                    (B)
                                    In the case of a proprietary institution submitting an application for conversion, or a pretransaction review application for conversion, the institution shall be required to pay to the Secretary an administrative fee that shall—
                                    
                                       (i)

                                          50 percent shall be available to the Secretary without further appropriation, exclusively for expenses related to the processing of such application; and

                                          50 percent shall be remitted by the Secretary to the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue, and shall be available, without further appropriation, to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue exclusively for purposes of determining whether the institution seeking such conversion or pretransaction review is an institution exempt from tax and is otherwise in compliance with applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
                                       
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    (C)
                                    An institution that pays a fee under subparagraph (A) or (B) for a pretransaction application with respect to a proposed transaction shall not be required to pay another fee under such subparagraph for a change in ownership application with respect to such transaction.
                                 
                                 
                                    (D)
                                    In no case may any fee remitted under subparagraph (A) or (B) exceed $120,000 for any transaction (or pretransaction) application, nor may the Secretary require an institution that has paid a fee under subparagraph (B) to pay an additional fee under subparagraph (A).

                                    (A)
                                    The Secretary shall approve or deny a materially complete application (including pretransaction reviews and conversion applications) submitted under this section as soon as practicable and not later than the 90-day period beginning on the date of receipt of such an application, except that in a case in which the Secretary determines, on a nondelegable basis, that good cause exists to not make the determination during such 90-day period, the Secretary shall notify the institution in writing detailing the reasons for a good cause extension.
                                 
                                 
                                    (B)
                                    If the Secretary fails to approve or deny a materially complete application during the period described in subparagraph (A) and does not find good cause for extension, the materially complete application shall be deemed approved.
                                 
                                 
                                    (C)
                                    In no case may the Secretary grant a good cause extension under this section to an institution for more than one month at a time, or for a total of more than more than 12 months.
                                 
                                 
                                    (D)
                                    To ensure timely submission of all relevant documentation, the Secretary may deny an application if an institution does not make a good faith effort to submit to the Secretary, in a timely manner—
                                    
                                       (i)
                                       all relevant documentation; or
                                    
                                    
                                       (ii)
                                       a materially complete application.
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    (E)
                                    
                                       (i)
                                       Upon approving or denying an application under this paragraph, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the reasoning for such approval or denial, including—
                                       
                                          (I)
                                          a copy of the approval or denial letter sent to the institution; and
                                       
                                       
                                          (II)
                                          any analysis regarding how the Secretary determined under paragraph 7(A)(iii) that a director of the institution was an interested or disinterested party to the transaction.
                                       
                                    
                                    
                                       (ii)
                                       The Secretary shall not publish under clause (i) any information that is otherwise exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5, United States Code (relating to the Freedom of Information Act), including trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.
                                    
                                 
                              
                              
                                 (7)
                                 
                                    (A)
                                    In the case of a proprietary institution that subsequent to the transaction would be owned and operated by an entity (in this paragraph referred to as the buyer) seeking to be recognized as a public or other nonprofit institution, the buyer shall meet the definition of a nonprofit institution under section 103(13) if—
                                    
                                       (i)
                                       the buyer pays no more than fair market value for any assets of the proprietary institution;
                                    
                                    
                                       (ii)
                                       the buyer pays no more than fair market value for any service or lease contracts, including such service and lease contracts provided by the entity selling the proprietary institution; and
                                    
                                    
                                       (iii)
                                       to prevent self-dealing in the case where one or more individuals with a substantial ownership or controlling interests in the proprietary institution will also have substantial or controlling interests in the institution seeking to be recognized as a public or other nonprofit institution (meaning that one or more individuals are on both sides of the transaction), the change of control transaction, and any substantial asset acquisition, service, or lease agreements with the proprietary institution shall be approved by a disinterested committee of directors of the entity that seeks to be recognized as a public or other nonprofit institution.
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    (B)
                                    For the purposes of this paragraph, parties to the transaction are entitled to a rebuttable presumption that the assets, lease contracts, and service contracts that are part of the transaction are purchased at fair market value if—
                                    
                                       (i)
                                       the acquiring entity pays no more than fair market value for such assets, lease contracts, or service contracts; and
                                    
                                    
                                       (ii)
                                       the value of the assets, lease contracts, or service contracts are evaluated by at least one independent third-party entity hired by parties on both sides of the transaction.
                                    
                                 
                              
                              
                                 (8)
                                 
                                    (A)
                                    An institution that has been approved for conversion by the Secretary shall be subject to a monitoring period for a 5-year period beginning on the day after the date of such approval.

                           The analyses required under subsections (a) and (b) shall be in addition to any other cost analysis required under law for a regulation implementing this title, including any cost analysis that may be required pursuant to Executive Order 12866 (58 Fed.

                                    (i)

                                    not using as a negative factor the institution’s religious mission based policies, decisions, and practices in the areas covered by subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) of paragraph (5), except that the agency or association may require that the institution’s or a program of study’s curricula include all core components required by the agency or association that are not inconsistent with the institution’s religious mission; and

                                    (i)
                                    in a case in which the instruction delivery model allows for the separation of the student from the instructor, the agency or association shall not be required to have separate standards, procedures, or policies for the evaluation of the quality of any instruction delivery model or method in order to meet the requirements of this subparagraph; and

                                       the agency or association requires that any process used by an institution to comply with the requirement under clause (I) does not infringe upon student privacy and is implemented in a manner that is minimally burdensome to the student;
