      118th CONGRESS

      H. R. 5961
      IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
      
         December 4, 2023
         Received; read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations
      
      AN ACT
      To freeze certain Iranian funds involved in the 2023 hostage deal between the United States and Iran, and for other purposes.
   
   
      Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
      
         1.
         SHORT TITLE
         This Act may be cited as the 
               No Funds for Iranian Terrorism Act
            .
      
      
         2.
         FINDINGS
         Congress makes the following findings:
         
            (1)
            On October 7, 2023, Iran-backed Hamas terrorists launched a massive, unprovoked war on Israel by air, land, and sea, in which they engaged in the brutal murder of over 1,300 people and kidnapped at least 230 people who are now being held hostage.
         
         
            (2)
            Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah have all been designated by the United States as Foreign Terrorist Organizations pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189).
         
         
            (3)
            Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and associated terrorist organizations backed by Iran routinely and unabashedly use civilians as “human shields” to shield their weapons and terrorist militants from legitimate military engagement, a contravention of international humanitarian law and a heinous violation of the rights and dignity of civilian noncombatants. 
         
         
            (4)
            Only the cessation of Hamas’ operations, the unconditional surrender of Hamas, and the immediate dismantlement of Hamas and all other Iran-backed terrorist organizations that participated in the massacre of Israelis on and since October 7, 2023, will ensure that innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilian lives are saved.
         
         
            (5)
            According to an unclassified United States government assessment, Iran has historically provided up to $100 million annually in combined support to Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command..
         
         
            (6)
            As National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stated on October 10, 2023, Iran is complicit in this attack in a broad sense because they have provided the lion’s share of the funding for the military wing of Hamas, they have provided training, they have provided capabilities, they have provided support, and they have provided engagement and contact with Hamas over years and years..
         
         
            (7)
            President Biden reached an agreement with the Iranian regime to bring home Siamak Namazi, Morad Tahbaz, Emad Shargi, and two additional American hostages all of whom were wrongfully detained in Iran.
         
      
      
         3.
