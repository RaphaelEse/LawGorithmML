         PROTECTING COMMUNITIES FROM PLASTICS
         
            201.
            SHORT TITLE
            This title may be cited as the 
                  Protecting Communities from Plastics Act
               .
         
         
            202.
            FINDINGS
            Congress finds that—
            
               (1)
               plastics production is exacerbating the climate crisis and driving environmental injustice in vulnerable communities located near petrochemical facilities;
            
            
               (2)
               plastics production is on track to double in the decade beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, locking in harmful emissions for decades;
            
            
               (3)
               plastics and other petrochemicals are forecasted to become the largest driver of oil and hydraulically fractured gas demand by 2050;
            
            
               (4)
               some studies have projected that the plastics industry will emit more greenhouse gas emissions than coal plants in the United States by 2030;
            
            
               (5)
               petrochemical facilities that produce plastics are more likely to be located in low-income communities and communities of color, disproportionately exposing those communities to harmful pollutants;
            
            
               (6)
               plastics production and certain disposal facilities pollute surrounding communities with chemicals that are known to cause cancer, birth defects, and other serious illnesses;
            
            
               (7)
               transitioning from the use of fossil fuels for power generation and transportation only to replace that demand with more fossil fuel-based plastics production—
               
                  (A)
                  is not a viable strategy; and
               
               
                  (B)
                  fails to protect communities;
               
            
            
               (8)
               plastics carry impacts throughout the lifecycle, including the impacts of—
               
                  (A)
                  oil and gas extraction;
               
               
                  (B)
                  plastics refining, manufacturing, and certain methods of disposal; and
               
               
                  (C)
                  resulting plastics pollution in communities and the environment, where the degrading plastics—
                  
                     (i)
                     leach chemical additives; and
                  
                  
                     (ii)
                     emit greenhouse gases;
                  
               
            
            
               (9)
               addressing the plastics crisis requires a shift away from single-use plastics in nonessential settings; and
            
            
               (10)
               technologies that convert plastics to fuel, use plastics for energy generation, generate feedstocks for the chemical industry, or produce hazardous waste and toxic air pollution are not a sustainable solution to the plastics crisis.
            
         
         
            203.
