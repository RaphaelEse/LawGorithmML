                        (A)
                        to limit a minor’s access to the service, which may utilize a system of age-rating;

                     In general
                     The term input-transparent algorithm means an algorithmic ranking system that does not use the user-specific data of a user to determine the selection, order, relative prioritization, or relative prominence of information that is furnished to such user on an online platform, unless the user-specific data is expressly provided to the platform by the user for such purpose. 
                  
                  
                     (B)
                     Data expressly provided to the platform
                     For purposes of subparagraph (A), user-specific data that is provided by a user for the express purpose of determining the selection, order, relative prioritization, or relative prominence of information that is furnished to such user on an online platform—
                     
                        (i)
                        shall include user-supplied search terms, filters, speech patterns (if provided for the purpose of enabling the platform to accept spoken input or selecting the language in which the user interacts with the platform), saved preferences, the resumption of a previous search, and the current precise geolocation information that is supplied by the user;
                     
                     
                        (ii)
                        shall include the user's current approximate geolocation information;
                     
                     
                        (iii)
                        shall include data submitted to the platform by the user that expresses the user's desire to receive particular information, such as the social media profiles the user follows, the video channels the user subscribes to, or other content or sources of content on the platform the user has selected;
                     
                     
                        (iv)
                        shall not include the history of the user's connected device, including the user's history of web searches and browsing, previous geographical locations, physical activity, device interaction, and financial transactions; and
                     
                     
                        (v)
                        shall not include inferences about the user or the user's connected device, without regard to whether such inferences are based on data described in clause (i) or (iii).
                     
                  
               
               
                  (6)
                  Online platform
                  The term online platform means any public-facing website, online service, online application, or mobile application that predominantly provides a community forum for user-generated content, such as sharing videos, images, games, audio files, or other content, including a social media service, social network, or virtual reality environment.

                     (A)
                     In general
                     The term opaque algorithm means an algorithmic ranking system that determines the selection, order, relative prioritization, or relative prominence of information that is furnished to such user on an online platform based, in whole or part, on user-specific data that was not expressly provided by the user to the platform for such purpose.
                  
                  
                     (B)
                     Exception for age-appropriate content filters
                     Such term shall not include an algorithmic ranking system used by an online platform if—
                     
                        (i)
                        the only user-specific data (including inferences about the user) that the system uses is information relating to the age of the user; and
                     
                     
                        (ii)
                        such information is only used to restrict a user's access to content on the basis that the individual is not old enough to access such content.

               REQUIREMENT TO ALLOW USERS TO SEE UNMANIPULATED CONTENT ON INTERNET PLATFORMS
               
                  (a)
                  In general
                  Beginning on the date that is 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, it shall be unlawful for any person to operate an online platform that uses an opaque algorithm unless the person complies with the requirements of subsection (b).
               
               
                  (b)
                  Opaque algorithm requirements
                  
                     (1)
                     In general
                     The requirements of this subsection with respect to a person that operates an online platform that uses an opaque algorithm are the following:
                     
                        (A)
                        The person provides users of the platform with the following notices:
                        
                           (i)
                           Notice that the platform uses an opaque algorithm that uses user-specific data to select the content the user sees. Such notice shall be presented in a clear and conspicuous manner on the platform whenever the user interacts with an opaque algorithm for the first time, and may be a one-time notice that can be dismissed by the user.
                        
                        
                           (ii)
                           Notice, to be included in the terms and conditions of the online platform, in a clear, accessible, and easily comprehensible manner that is to be updated whenever the online platform makes a material change, of—
                           
                              (I)
                              the most salient features, inputs, and parameters used by the algorithm;
                           
                           
                              (II)
                              how any user-specific data used by the algorithm is collected or inferred about a user of the platform, and the categories of such data;
                           
                           
                              (III)
                              any options that the online platform makes available for a user of the platform to opt out or exercise options under subparagraph (B), modify the profile of the user or to influence the features, inputs, or parameters used by the algorithm; and
                           
                           
                              (IV)
                              any quantities, such as time spent using a product or specific measures of engagement or social interaction, that the algorithm is designed to optimize, as well as a general description of the relative importance of each quantity for such ranking. 
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        (B)
                        The online platform enables users to easily switch between the opaque algorithm and an input-transparent algorithm in their use of the platform.
                     
                  
                  
                     (2)
                     Rule of construction
                     Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an online platform to disclose any information, including data or algorithms—
                     
                        (A)
                        relating to a trade secret or other protected intellectual property;

                     (3)
                     Prohibition on differential pricing
                     An online platform shall not deny, charge different prices or rates for, or condition the provision of a service or product to a user based on the user’s election to use an input-transparent algorithm in their use of the platform, as provided under paragraph (1)(B).

For purposes of enforcing this title or a regulation promulgated under this title, State attorneys general shall take into account any guidance issued by the Commission under subparagraph (A).
