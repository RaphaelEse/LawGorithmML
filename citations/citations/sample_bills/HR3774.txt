               (A)

               (B)
               support international terrorism; or
            
            
               (C)
               fund the development and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and weapons delivery systems;
            
         
         
            (2)
            to deny Iran funds to oppress and commit human rights violations against the Iranian people assembling to peacefully redress the Iranian regime;

            (4)
