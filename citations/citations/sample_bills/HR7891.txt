               Opaque algorithm
               
                  (A)
                  In general
                  The term opaque algorithm means an algorithmic ranking system that determines the selection, order, relative prioritization, or relative prominence of information that is furnished to such user on an online platform based, in whole or part, on user-specific data that was not expressly provided by the user to the platform for such purpose.
               
               
                  (B)
                  Exception for age-appropriate content filters
                  Such term shall not include an algorithmic ranking system used by an online platform if—
                  
                     (i)
                     the only user-specific data (including inferences about the user) that the system uses is information relating to the age of the user; and
                  
                  
                     (ii)
                     such information is only used to restrict a user’s access to content on the basis that the individual is not old enough to access such content.

               The term precise geolocation information means geolocation information that identifies an individual’s location to within a range of 5 miles or less.
            
            
               (9)
               User-specific data
               The term user-specific data means information relating to an individual or a specific connected device that would not necessarily be true of every individual or device.

            REQUIREMENT TO ALLOW USERS TO SEE UNMANIPULATED CONTENT ON INTERNET PLATFORMS
            
               (a)
               In general
               Beginning on the date that is 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, it shall be unlawful for any person to operate an online platform that uses an opaque algorithm unless the person complies with the requirements of subsection (b).
            
            
               (b)
               Opaque algorithm requirements
               
                  (1)
                  In general
                  The requirements of this subsection with respect to a person that operates an online platform that uses an opaque algorithm are the following:
                  
                     (A)
                     The person provides notice to users of the platform—
                     
                        (i)
                        that the platform uses an opaque algorithm that uses user-specific data to select the content the user sees. Such notice shall be presented in a clear and conspicuous manner on the platform whenever the user interacts with an opaque algorithm for the first time, and may be a one-time notice that can be dismissed by the user; and
                     
                     
                        (ii)
                        in the terms and conditions of the online platform, in a clear, accessible, and easily comprehensible manner that is to be updated whenever the online platform makes a material change to—
                        
                           (I)
                           the most salient features, inputs, and parameters used by the algorithm;
                        
                        
                           (II)
                           how any user-specific data used by the algorithm is collected or inferred about a user of the platform, and the categories of such data;
                        
                        
                           (III)
                           any options that the online platform makes available for a user of the platform to opt out or exercise options under subparagraph (B), modify the profile of the user or to influence the features, inputs, or parameters used by the algorithm; and
                        
                        
                           (IV)
                           any quantities, such as time spent using a product or specific measures of engagement or social interaction, that the algorithm is designed to optimize, as well as a general description of the relative importance of each quantity for such ranking.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     (B)
                     The online platform enables users to easily switch between the opaque algorithm and an input-transparent algorithm in their use of the platform.
                  
               
               
                  (2)
                  Rule of construction
                  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an online platform to disclose any information, including data or algorithms—
                  
                     (A)
                     relating to a trade secret or other protected intellectual property;
                  
                  
                     (B)
                     that is confidential business information; or
                  
                  
                     (C)
                     that is privileged.
                  
               
               
                  (3)
                  Prohibition on differential pricing
                  An online platform shall not deny, charge different prices or rates for, or condition the provision of a service or product to a user based on the user’s election to use an input-transparent algorithm in their use of the platform, as provided under paragraph (1)(B).
               
            
            
               (c)

                  A violation of this section by an operator of an online platform shall be treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)).
               
               
                  (2)
                  Powers of commission
                  
                     (A)
                     In general
                     The Federal Trade Commission shall enforce this section in the same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) were incorporated into and made a part of this section.
                  
                  
                     (B)
                     Privileges and immunities
                     Except as provided in subparagraph (C), any person who violates this Act shall be subject to the penalties and entitled to the privileges and immunities provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.).
                  
                  
                     (C)
                     Authority preserved
                     Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Commission under any other provision of law.
                  
               
            
            
               (d)
               Rule of construction To preserve personalized blocks
               Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or prohibit an online platform’s ability to, at the direction of an individual user or group of users, restrict another user from searching for, finding, accessing, or interacting with such user’s or group’s account, content, data, or online community.
            
         
         
            203.
            SEVERABILITY
            If any provision of this title, or an amendment made by this title, is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, the remaining provisions of this title and the amendments made by this title shall not be affected.

            301.
            RELATIONSHIP TO STATE LAWS
            The provisions of this Act shall preempt any State law, rule, or regulation only to the extent that such State law, rule, or regulation conflicts with a provision of this Act. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit a State from enacting a law, rule, or regulation that provides greater protection to minors than the protection provided by the provisions of this Act.
