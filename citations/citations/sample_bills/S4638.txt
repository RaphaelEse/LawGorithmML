                        (3)
                        The aircraft carrier industrial base includes more than 2,000 companies in 44 States that contribute to the construction and maintenance of these complex and technologically advanced ships.
                     
                     
                        (4)
                        The benefits of stable, executable aircraft carrier procurement plans extend throughout the aircraft carrier industrial base, promoting the development and retention of highly skilled workforces and capital investments in world-class manufacturing and shipbuilding facilities throughout the United States.
                     
                     
                        (5)
                        Aircraft carrier procurement plans accompanying the President's budget request for fiscal years 2023 and 2024 forecast procurement of the CVN–82 carrier in fiscal year 2028, however, the fiscal year 2025 plan defers procurement until fiscal year 2030, creating a significant and destabilizing production gap for the aircraft carrier industrial base.
                     
                  
                  
                     (b)
                     Sense of Congress
                     It is the sense of Congress that—
                     
                        (1)
                        the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy should implement aircraft carrier acquisition strategies that maximize benefits to operational commanders while simultaneously protecting the interests of the taxpayer and supporting the national nuclear shipbuilding industrial base;
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy should review and revise the acquisition strategy, including a two-ship buy of the CVN–82 and CVN–83 carriers, for Ford-class aircraft carriers in the President's budget request for fiscal year 2026 to ensure the strategy is consistent with accepted shipbuilding industrial base analyses, prior Department of Defense recommendations, reports to Congress, congressional resolutions, section 8062 of title 10, United States Code, and national security interests; and
                     
                     
                        (3)
                        the Secretary of Defense should request procurement of the CVN–82 carrier not later than fiscal year 2028.

                  MODIFICATION OF AUTHORITY TO SEPARATE OFFICERS WHEN IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE SERVICE
                  Section 1182(d) of title 10, United States Code, is amended—
                  
                     (1)
                     by amending paragraph (1) to read as follows:
                     
                        
                           (1)
                           
                              (A)
                              If a board of inquiry determines that an officer should be retained, the officer’s case is closed unless the board substantiated a basis for separation and, upon recommendation from the service chief, the Secretary of the military department determines that the board’s retention recommendation is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence considered by the board, a miscarriage of justice, and inconsistent with the best interest of the service. In such cases, the Secretary of the military department may separate the officer after providing a written justification of the decision to separate. 
                           
                           
                              (B)
                              An officer considered for separation under this section must be notified and afforded the opportunity to present matters for the Secretary of the military department to consider when making the separation determination. The Secretary of the military department shall review the case to determine whether the retention recommendation of the board is clearly contrary to the substantial weight of the evidence in the record and whether the officer’s conduct discredits the Service, adversely affects good order and discipline, and adversely affects the officer’s performance of duty. 
                           
                           
                              (C)
                              Exercise of authority to separate an officer under this section shall be reserved for unusual cases where such action is essential to the interests of justice, discipline, and proper administration of the service.
                           
                        
                        ;

                     by redesignating paragraphs (2) and (3) as paragraphs (3) and (4), respectively; and
                  
                  
                     (3)
                     by inserting after paragraph (1) the following new paragraph:
                     
                        
                           (2)
                           Authority to direct administrative separation after a board of inquiry’s recommendation to retain an officer may only be delegated to a civilian official within a military department appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The least favorable characterization in such cases will be general (under honorable conditions).

                     (a)
                     Findings
                     Congress finds that—
                     
                        (1)
                        many United States citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States with a propensity to serve the United States are not medically qualified to serve in the United States Armed Forces, but have great potential to contribute to the overall security of the nation, especially throughout the civil service and in the defense industrial base; 
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        in 2024, the defense industrial base is experiencing a shortfall of qualified workers, resulting in delayed production of critical platforms that support the security of the United States; and
                     
                     
                        (3)
                        individuals who volunteer to serve in the military, but are ultimately medically disqualified from enlistment, are likely to possess many of the attributes that will lead to successful careers in other aspects of national service.

                        In general
                        Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, in collaboration with the Secretaries concerned (as defined in section 101(a) of title 10, United States Code), shall begin offering the course described in paragraph (2) to individuals who volunteer to enlist or commission in the Armed Forces but who are ultimately disqualified by a Military Entrance Processing Station.

                           workforce development opportunities that lead to employment within the defense industrial base; 
                        
                        
                           (B)
                           education opportunities that result in civil service jobs in the Department of Defense; and
                        
                        
                           (C)

                  SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION
                  It is the sense of the Senate that—
                  
                     (1)
                     the success of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is critical to advancing United States national security objectives in Europe, the Indo-Pacific region, and around the world;
                  
                  
                     (2)
                     2024 marks 75 years since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance was founded, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization remains the strongest and most successful military alliance in the world, founded on a commitment by its members to uphold the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law;
                  
                  
                     (3)
                     the United States reaffirms its ironclad commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as the foundation of transatlantic security and to upholding its obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty, including its commitment to collective defense under Article 5 of the Treaty;
                  
                  
                     (4)
                     the unprovoked and illegal full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation has fundamentally altered the security landscape in Europe and necessitates the unrelenting support of the transatlantic alliance for Ukraine's self defense;
                  
                  
                     (5)
                     welcoming Finland and Sweden as the 31st and 32nd members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, respectively, has made the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance stronger and has enhanced collective security by increasing the capabilities and stability of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance, particularly in the Baltic Sea region and Northern Europe;
                  
                  
                     (6)
                     North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries that have not yet met the two-percent defense spending pledge, as agreed to at the 2014 Wales Summit, should meet the timeline as expeditiously as possible;
                  
                  
                     (7)
                     it is imperative that the United States and international allies and partners continue every effort to identify, synchronize, and deliver needed assistance to Ukraine as Ukraine continues the fight against the illegal and unjust war of the Russian Federation;
                  
                  
                     (8)
                     the regional plans, agreed to by all North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries at the Vilnius Summit in 2023, provide important clarity on the forces, capabilities, and readiness levels needed to defend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance, and allies should move expeditiously to implement the plans;
                  
                  
                     (9)
                     the United States and fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies should continue long-term efforts—
                     
                        (A)
                        to improve interoperability among the military forces of North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies so as to enhance collective operations, including the divestment of Soviet-era capabilities;
                     
                     
                        (B)
                        to enhance security sector cooperation and explore opportunities to reinforce civil sector preparedness and resilience measures that may be likely targets of malign influence campaigns;
                     
                     
                        (C)
                        to mitigate the impact of hybrid warfare operations, particularly those in the information and cyber domains; and
                     
                     
                        (D)
                        to expand joint research and development initiatives with a focus on emerging technologies such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, including through the work of the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic initiative (commonly known as DIANA);
                     
                  
                  
                     (10)
                     the European Deterrence Initiative remains critically important and has demonstrated its unique value to the United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies during the current Russian Federation-created war against Ukraine;
                  
                  
                     (11)
                     the United States should continue to work with allies and partners to build permanent mechanisms to strengthen supply chains, enhance supply chain security, and fill supply chain gaps;
                  
                  
                     (12)
                     the United States should prioritize collaboration with fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to secure enduring and robust critical munitions supply chains so as to increase military readiness;
                  
                  
                     (13)
                     the United States and fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies should expand cooperation efforts on cybersecurity issues to prevent adversaries and criminals from compromising critical systems and infrastructure;
                  
                  
                     (14)
                     the Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, continue to serve as model allies, including through their defense investments, modernization of key capabilities, and their steadfast assistance to Ukraine, among myriad other examples;
                  
                  
                     (15)
                     the security situation in the Western Balkans remains dynamic, and military-to-military cooperation among the United States, the European Union, and fellow NATO allies to maintain peace and security in the Western Balkans is critically important; and
                  
                  
                     (16)
                     the efforts of the Russian Federation to assert military, political, and economic dominance in the Black Sea, though unsuccessful, threaten the peace and stability of the littoral countries of the Black Sea and should remain a focus area for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance.

                                    Any other failure of controls or performance of a nature so serious or compelling as to warrant placement of the contractor on the list.

                  SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CONGRESSIONAL STRATEGIC POSTURE COMMISSION
                  
                     (a)
                     Sense of the Senate
                     It is the sense of the Senate that—
                     
                        (1)
                        on October 12, 2023, the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States (referred to in this section as the Commission) released a final report entitled America’s Strategic Posture;
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        the report, the consensus product of a 12-person bipartisan commission established by section 1687 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (Public Law 117–81; 135 Stat. 2126) and led by the Honorable Madelyn Creedon and former Senator Jon Kyl—
                        
                           (A)
                           examined the latest intelligence available on current and projected global strategic threats;
                        
                        
                           (B)
                           assessed the adequacy of existing United States strategies, policies, and capabilities for addressing such threats; and
                        
                        
                           (C)
                           provided a series of findings and recommendations, which were subsequently made available to the President, Congress, and the general public;
                        
                     
                     
                        (3)
                        the findings of the Commission reflect a deteriorating international security situation that is becoming far more dangerous for the United States and its allies and partners;
                     
                     
                        (4)
                        the rapid and unprecedented growth of the nuclear arsenal of the People’s Republic of China, the massive expansion of its armed forces, and its increasingly aggressive stance across all domains have forever altered the global balance of power;
                     
                     
                        (5)
                        the Government of the Russian Federation owns, and will likely maintain for the foreseeable future, the largest nuclear arsenal on Earth;
                     
                     
                        (6)
                        the Government of the Russian Federation—
                        
                           (A)
                           continues to expand and diversify its nuclear arsenal, air and missile defenses, and space, cyber, biological, and chemical weapons capabilities; and
                        
                        
                           (B)
                           regularly flaunts such capabilities to threaten and intimidate regional neighbors;
                        
                     
                     
                        (7)
                        continued efforts by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to expand and diversify its nuclear arsenal, long-range missile systems, and chemical and biological weapons programs and the clear willingness to leverage such systems and programs to threaten and intimidate regional neighbors poses a growing danger to stability in Northeast Asia;
                     
                     
                        (8)
                        the growth of the intercontinental ballistic missile forces of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea presents an acute danger to the people of the United States;
                     
                     
                        (9)
                        the Islamic Republic of Iran is committed to a long-term goal of further developing increasingly destabilizing missile technologies and acquiring nuclear weapons to dominate the greater Middle East;
                     
                     
                        (10)
                        taken together, such findings reflect a global security environment very different from any the United States has ever encountered;
                     
                     
                        (11)
                        while the United States served as a bulwark against the Soviet Union, enduring the distant existential threat the Government of the Soviet Union posed for decades, and defied the persistent daily threat of terrorism from the earliest days of the 21st century, the United States has never faced a more complex set of global threats than are arrayed before it as of the date of the enactment of this Act; and
                     
                     
                        (12)
                        the United States, in order to maintain its position in the international order, must recognize this new threat environment, and urgently take prompt, decisive action to transform its aging array of defenses, renovate long-neglected industrial capabilities, rebuild a strong and vibrant workforce, rebuild allied confidence in the support and leadership of the United States, and craft a common, unifying vision of purpose for all United States citizens.

                        (3)
                        the individual will not be provided access to any classified information and all appropriate protective measures will be taken to ensure the risk of inadvertent access is minimized to the maximum extent possible;

                  AUTHORIZATION OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND CONTRACTORS TO ACQUIRE AND OPERATE A UTILIZATION FACILITY
                  
                     (a)
                     Findings
                     Congress finds the following:
                     
                        (1)
                        Project Pele holds great potential as the only mobile microreactor design currently being constructed.
                     
                     
                        (2)
                        The Department of Defense maintains nuclear indemnification authority through the Act entitled An Act to authorize the making, amendment and modification of contracts to facilitate the national defense, approved August 28, 1958 (50 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.)(referred to in this section as Public Law 85–804).
                     
                     
                        (3)
                        The Nuclear Power Program of the Army previously operated nuclear power reactors from 1957 until 1977 with one of the predecessor organizations of the Department of Energy, the Atomic Energy Commission.
                     
                     
                        (4)
                        Public Law 85–804 and the joint production of nuclear power reactors between the Army and the Department of Energy both provide potential pathways for the Department of Defense, and contractors on behalf of the Department of Defense, in ensuring such reactors are properly indemnified throughout their lifecycle.
                     
                     
                        (5)
