      IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

      Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
      
         1.
         SHORT TITLE
         This Act may be cited as the 
               Violent Incident Clearance and Technological Investigative Methods Act of 2022
             or 
               VICTIM Act of 2022
            .
       
      
         2.
         FINDINGS
         Congress finds the following: 
         
            (1)
            Research indicates that law enforcement agencies can increase clearance rates by improving— 
            
               (A)
               investigative processes; 
             
            
               (B)
               detective capacities; and 
             
            
               (C)
               organizational oversight and supervision of investigations.
            
          
         
            (2)
            When a law enforcement agency expends additional investigative effort, the law enforcement agency improves its success in gaining cooperation of key witnesses and increases the amount of forensic evidence collected.
          
         
            (3)
            Effective investigation of shootings can prevent subsequent related violence by— 
            
               (A)
               deterring retaliation; and
             
            
               (B)
               providing interventions to individuals who may continue to commit crimes or become victims of retaliatory violence.
            
          
         
            (4)
            Law enforcement agencies that demonstrate higher rates of clearance for violent crimes committed against a person— 
            
               (A)
               have more structured oversight and formal interactions between investigative units and agency leadership;
             
            
               (B)
               are more likely to have investigative units that have collaborative relationships and robust information sharing with other units of the law enforcement agency;
             
            
               (C)
               have investigative units that have specific goals and performance metrics for both the unit and for investigators within the unit;
             
            
               (D)
               have investigators who more frequently respond to the initial crime scene shortly after crimes have been reported to collect evidence and interview witnesses;
             
            
               (E)
               have investigators who either have specialized experience before joining investigative units or are trained in investigations once they join those units;
             
            
               (F)
               often have standard operating procedures for investigations that establish policies and evidence-based best practices for conducting and completing homicide investigations; and
             
            
               (G)
               have better relationships with the communities they serve, even if no specific community-oriented campaign or initiative exists between investigative units and community groups. 
            
          
         
            (5)
            Criminal justice agencies should collaborate with each other and share best practices for solving violent crimes committed against a person.
          
         
            (6)
            A comprehensive community engagement strategy concerning gun violence is essential to improving clearance rates for violent crimes committed against a person.
