# The Semantic Citation Challenge

The current dataset tells you _where_ citations appear, but not _why_ they appear. Consider:

- How might the surrounding context be used to infer whether a citation supports a legal argument, establishes precedent, or provides clarification?
- Could network analysis reveal clusters or patterns that hint at different citation roles?

Your innovative solutions to add semantic labels or classifications to these citations could transform this dataset into a powerful tool for legal analysis, alerting, etc.

## Repository Structure

**sample_bills/**  
Contains plain-text legislative bill documents. These represent the source texts from which citation data were derived.

**citations/**  
Contains:

- **JSON files:** Each file corresponds to a bill and lists detected legal citations (with positional metadata). Note that these files include only structural information about citationsâ€”not any semantic labels.
- **Visualization & Analysis Scripts:**
  - `sankey_visualization.py` & `sankey_data_processing.py`: Generate interactive Sankey diagrams to illustrate how bills connect to various legal provisions.
  - `prepare_for_neo4j.py`: Converts citation data into CSV files for import into a Neo4j graph database.

| **normCite**             | A normalized version of the citation text, standardized for consistency (e.g., ensuring uniform formatting for legal citations).                                               |
| **citeType**             | Indicates the type or category of the citation (for example, "USC" for United States Code, "CFR" for Code of Federal Regulations, etc.).                                    |
| **altCite**              | An alternative representation of the citation, if available. This may offer additional formatting or details not present in the primary citation string.                     |
| **pinCiteStr**           | A string used for pinpoint references within a larger citation, indicating a specific location (if applicable).                                                              |
| **pageRangeStr**         | A string representing the page range when a citation spans multiple pages.                                                                                                   |
| **nodeId**               | A unique identifier assigned to the citation object, which is useful for linking and referencing within visualizations or other processing tools.                           |
| **section**              | A parsed component of the citation that typically corresponds to a legal section number (if the citation includes such a breakdown).                                         |
| **sectionAndSubSection** | A more detailed breakdown that includes both the section and any subsections, providing a hierarchical view of the citation reference.                                      |
| **isShortCite**          | A boolean flag indicating whether the citation is a shortened reference (true) or a full citation (false).                                                                    |
