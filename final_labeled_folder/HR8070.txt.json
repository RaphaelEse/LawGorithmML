(c) Goals The goals of the pilot program are to leverage AI solutions to\u2014 (1) optimize logistics operations and inventory management, specifically within the United States Indo-Pacific Command Area of Responsibility; (2) improve military force readiness; (3) streamline materiel distribution and logistics optimization; (4) improve situational awareness by providing predictions driven by a modular, probabilistic simulation of logistics processes in the face of uncertainty; (5) enhance productivity by minimizing and, where possible, automating reporting and inter- actions with data systems; and (6) scale Marine Corps integration of AI-enhanced logistics and supply chain solutions to solve operational challenges. (d) Briefing By December 1 of each year in which the pilot program is carried out, the Commandant of the Marine Corps shall provide to the congressional defense committees a report that includes\u2014 (1) a description of the logistics and supply chain problem sets that were evaluated by the pilot program; (2) an assessment of the impact of using AI to solve supply chain and logistics challenges, including any changes to readiness, budget efficiency, and productivity of military equipment and materiel; (3) any barriers identified to using AI to solve supply chain and logistics challenges; (4) recommendations regarding how the Department of Defense can better leverage artificial intelligence to address supply chain and logistics challenges in a contested environment; (5) an assessment of the impact of AI software solutions on visibility of materiel at different levels of command within the Marine Corps; and (6) the viability of expanding these software solutions to other units and areas of responsibility.",
